Spreadsheets are the go-to information hub for individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes to store data. However, large data sets can make it difficult to identify trends, pick out key pieces of information, and track deadlines. Luckily, Microsoft Excel has a feature called conditional formatting that alleviates some of these challenges. 
Conditional formatting enables you to apply special formatting to cells in your spreadsheet that meet certain criteria. Excel has a sizable library of preset conditions that you can apply fairly simply, or you can create your own conditional formatting rules using Excel formulas. This guide will provide in-depth step-by-step examples of the most popular conditional formatting functions for basic and advanced users in Excel 2016. Then, we’ll show you how to perform the same functions in another spreadsheet application, Smartsheet.
Conditional formatting is a feature of many spreadsheet applications that allows you to apply special formatting to cells that meet certain criteria. It is most often used to highlight, emphasize, or differentiate among data and information stored in a spreadsheet. 
Conditional formatting enables spreadsheet users to do a number of things. First and foremost, it calls attention to important data points such as deadlines, at-risk tasks, or budget items. It can also make large data sets more digestible by breaking up the wall of numbers with a visual organizational component. Finally, conditional formatting can transform your spreadsheet (that previously only stored data) into a dependable “alert” system that highlights key information and keeps you on top of your workload. 
Originally a powerful feature of Excel, other spreadsheet applications have also adopted this functionality. 
2. Although Excel ships with many conditional formatting "presets", these are limited. A more powerful way to apply conditional formatting is formulas, because formulas allow you to apply rules based on any logic you want. This article shows how to highlight rows, column differences, missing values, and how to build Gantt charts and search boxes with conditional formatting.
Conditional formatting is a fantastic way to quickly visualize data in a spreadsheet. With conditional formatting, you can do things like highlight dates in the next 30 days, flag data entry problems, highlight rows that contain top customers, show duplicates, and more.
Excel ships with a large number of "presets" that make it easy to create new rules without formulas. However, you can also create rules with your own custom formulas. By using your own formula, you take over the condition that triggers a rule and can apply exactly the logic you need. Formulas give you maximum power and flexibility.
For example, using the "Equal to" preset, it's easy to highlight cells equal to "apple".
But what if you want to highlight cells equal to "apple" or "kiwi" or "lime"? Sure, you can create a rule for each value, but that's a lot of trouble. Instead, you can simply use one rule based on a formula with the OR function:

3. Conditional formatting can help make patterns and trends in your data more apparent. To use it, you create rules that determine the format of cells based on their values, such as the following monthly temperature data with cell colors tied to cell values
You can apply conditional formatting to a range of cells (either a selection or a named range), an Excel table, and in Excel for Windows, even a PivotTable report.
4.  Merging cells in Excel allows you to combine the contents of several cells into one cell with one cell reference (the upper-left cell reference). By merging cells, only the content from the upper-left cell in the range will be retained.
The Merge & Center button, located on the top banner of the HOME tab, includes the following merging options:
•	Merge Cells – Merges the range into a single cell, but will not horizontally center the content
•	Merge & Center – Merges the range of cells into one cell and horizontally centers the content
•	Merge Across – Merges each row in the selected range across the columns in the range
•	Unmerge Cells – Reverses the merge and returns the merged cell back to a range of individual cells
Let’s talk about each option and go through a few examples along the way.
5. One of the most important and widely used tasks that we have to accomplish while working in Excel is to merge cells vertically without losing any data. Today I’ll show you how you can merge cells in Excel vertically without lose
6. Use the Format Painter on the Home tab to quickly apply the same formatting, such as color, font style and size, and border style, to multiple pieces of text or graphics. The format painter lets you copy all of the formatting from one object and apply it to another one – think of it as copying and pasting for formatting.
1.	Select the text or graphic that has the formatting that you want to copy.
